# tugboat-android

Native Android host for the session engine
([ADR 0009](../../../docs/decisions/0009-shared-session-engine.md)).
Maven coordinates `com.gettugboat.sdk:tugboat-android:0.1.0`, namespace
`com.tugboat.android`, minSdk 24. Versioned on its own (ADR 0008, see
[CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)) and unpublished: the only repository is the
untracked `.local-maven`.

Status: platform plumbing only. There is no public API and no toolkit adapter
yet; every Kotlin type is `internal`.

## What it contains

| Piece | Where | Role |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Engine library | `src/main/cpp` | CMake builds `core/session-engine` (target `tugboat_session_engine`) into `libtugboat_engine.so` with `c++_static`, plus a JNI bridge: `create`, `submit`, `destroy`. Only the JNI symbols are exported. |
| Bridge | `engine/NativeEngine`, `JniEngineTransport` | `submit` copies the engine-owned response into a Java `byte[]` before returning. No exception crosses JNI; `EngineStatus` mirrors `tb_session_status`. |
| Host | `host/EngineHost` | Owns one handle and one `HandlerThread("tugboat-engine")`. See the threading notes below. |
| Clock | `host/HostClock` | `monoUs` in the `SystemClock.uptimeMillis` timebase (`uptimeNanos` on API 35+), `wallUs` from `currentTimeMillis`. |
| Effects | `host/Effect`, `EffectDispatcher` | `timer.schedule` / `timer.cancel` go to `TimerExecutor` (`Handler.postAtTime`). `http.send` goes to `HttpExecutor`. `frame.release` goes to `FrameHandleTable`. Unknown types are logged once. |
| HTTP | `host/HttpExecutor`, `RequestDeadline`, `CollectorResponse`, `MultipartBody` | `HttpURLConnection` on one `tugboat-io` thread, with the Flutter collector headers and multipart layout. `jsonBody` is sent byte for byte. `timeoutMs` is a total deadline: a watchdog disconnects at it. Every answer is one the engine accepts: the body is cut to at most 64 KiB at a UTF-8 boundary, and a status outside 100–599 becomes `error`. The multipart bytes are pinned by `conformance/host/multipart-request.golden`, shared with the Apple host. |

`EngineHost` threading and failure rules:

- `post(type, inputJson, at, frameHandles)` and `postBatch` can be called from
  any thread. Callers pass the time the fact happened. `postUntimed` is for
  `engine.configure`, queries, and stateless messages.
- Submits run serialized on the engine thread.
- A non-`ok` status is logged. The message is dropped and its frame handles
  are released.
- Three `internal_error`s in a row shut the host down.
- Shutting down (`close`, or the `internal_error` limit) first submits
  `engine.dispose` so the engine can report undelivered work. From its
  response `frame.release` runs, but no `http.send` or `timer.schedule`
  starts. Then the handle is destroyed.
- Nothing thrown on the engine or IO thread escapes.

## Build and test

From `platforms/android`:

```sh
./gradlew :tugboat-android:test                 # JVM + Robolectric unit tests
./gradlew :tugboat-android:assembleAndroidTest  # instrumented APK (real JNI)
./gradlew :tugboat-android:connectedAndroidTest # needs a device or emulator
```

`bash tool/ci/build-android-runtime.sh` from the repository root runs the first
two and builds the release AAR.

The instrumented test loads the real library and checks the
`fingerprint.labelHash` conformance fixture through JNI.
